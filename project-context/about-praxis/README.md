# What is PraxisOS

## TL;DR
- IMPORTANT: This praxis route is visible for every single user and project, not only for praxis owners. This route is explaining what is PraxisOS
- PraxisOS is a local-first kanban OS that gives AI agents structured access to tasks, roles, and project knowledge.
- AI agents interact with PraxisOS through MCP tools on port 7865  -  no accounts and no cloud storage of project data.
- The mandatory task lifecycle (7 steps) ensures agents receive full context before doing any work.
- Project knowledge lives in project-context/ and is queried via the search_project_context MCP tool.
- Assignees are JSON profiles in .praxis/assignees/ that define how an AI agent should behave on a task.
- The praxis-mcp-codex.md file is the behavioral rulebook every AI agent must read before starting work.
- context-router.md is a bootstrap seed for the initial project-context skeleton, not a live navigation compass.

This route exists so that any AI agent dropped into a PraxisOS-managed project can immediately understand what PraxisOS is, how it works, and how to interact with it. This is the self-awareness route.

## Purpose

When an AI agent starts working in a project that uses PraxisOS, it has no inherent knowledge of what PraxisOS is or how to interact with it. This route closes that gap by explaining:
- What PraxisOS is and why it exists.
- How the .praxis/ directory structures the project.
- What MCP tools are available and what they do.
- What the mandatory task lifecycle is and why it matters.
- How project context, assignees, and tasks work together.

Without this knowledge, an AI agent will treat .praxis/ as arbitrary config files and miss the structured collaboration protocol PraxisOS provides.

## What PraxisOS Is

PraxisOS is a local-first operating system for human-AI collaboration. It runs as a browser-based kanban board (React SPA) and manages tasks, AI agent roles, and project knowledge entirely on the user's local machine via the File System Access API.

PraxisOS solves four problems:
- Context amnesia: AI agents forget project rules every session. PraxisOS stores and delivers them automatically via MCP.
- No structured AI access: Without PraxisOS, developers manually copy-paste context between their project and AI tools. MCP tools eliminate this middleware role.
- AI-unfit task managers: Traditional tools (Jira, Trello) produce tickets for humans, not structured specs AI agents can consume. PraxisOS generates task specs with inlined assignee profiles, project context references, and behavioral constraints.
- Unsafe full autonomy: PraxisOS enforces human oversight at every consequential decision point. Agents execute within human-defined boundaries, never autonomously.

## How PraxisOS Works in a Project

When PraxisOS is initialized in a project, it creates the `.praxis/` directory:

```
.praxis/
  tasks/              # Task JSON files organized by status column
    new/
    in_progress/
    completed/
    on_hold/
    archived/
  assignees/          # AI agent role profiles (JSON files)
    assistant.json    # Default assignee, always present
  prompts/
    praxis-mcp-codex.md   # Behavioral rulebook for AI agents
  api/                # Local MCP server files (Python)
  chat/               # AI chat session data (optional)
```

Alongside `.praxis/`, PraxisOS creates:
- `context-router.md` at the project root: a bootstrap seed used to construct the initial project-context skeleton and to list top-level routes.
- `project-context/`: the knowledge base containing behavioral rules, architectural constraints, and domain documentation.
- `.mcp.json` at the project root (when MCP mode is enabled): tells Claude Code and MCP-compatible tools how to connect to the Praxis MCP server.

All data is local. No cloud service, no account, no sync layer. Everything is Git-trackable.

Project data is never uploaded to any server. The PraxisOS application itself is delivered over the network and requires connectivity to load.

## MCP Tools  -  How AI Agents Interact

The Praxis MCP server runs on `127.0.0.1:7865` and exposes structured tools via Streamable HTTP at `/stream`.
AI agents connect automatically when `.mcp.json` is present in the project root.

Core tools available to agents:
- `get_task`  -  fetch a task's full specification with inlined assignee profile.
- `get_active_tasks`  -  list tasks in new and in_progress columns.
- `list_tasks`  -  query tasks across all status columns.
- `find_task_by_keywords`  -  search tasks by keyword.
- `create_task`  -  create a new task on the kanban board.
- `update_task`  -  update task content fields.
- `update_task_status`  -  move a task between status columns (new, in_progress, to_review, completed, on_hold, archived).
- `get_assignees`  -  list all available AI agent profiles.
- `find_assignee_by_keywords`  -  search assignees by domain.
- `create_assignee`  -  create a new AI agent profile.
- `search_project_context`  -  keyword search over the project knowledge base (project-context/).
- `update_project_context`  -  get instructions for updating project documentation.
- `get_settings` / `update_settings`  -  read and update project configuration.
- `health`  -  check if the MCP server and Claude CLI are available.
- `AskUserQuestion`  -  ask the user a clarifying question mid-task.

All tools are loopback-only, tokenless, and path-addressed. The file system is the source of truth.

## The Mandatory Task Lifecycle

Every AI agent working on a PraxisOS task must follow this lifecycle. It is non-negotiable.

1. `update_task_status` -> `in_progress`  -  claim the task before any work.
2. `get_task`  -  read the full task specification (includes inlined assignee profile).
3. `search_project_context`  -  load domain knowledge from project-context/. Mandatory for every task, not just coding tasks.
4. Prepare execution trajectory  -  research, read files, build a plan. This step stays on the main agent, never delegated.
5. Execute the work  -  optionally delegate to a sub-agent with the plan from step 4.
6. `update_task_status` -> `to_review`  -  hand off for human review.
7. `update_project_context`  -  document what changed for future agents.

This lifecycle prevents context amnesia by ensuring agents always receive full task specs, role constraints, and project knowledge before starting work. Step 7 ensures new knowledge is captured for future sessions.

## Project Context System

The project knowledge base lives in `project-context/`. Each route is a directory with a `README.md` that documents behavioral rules, architectural constraints, and domain knowledge for one area of the project.

The `context-router.md` file at the project root is a bootstrap seed. It is used to construct the initial project-context skeleton and to list top-level routes.
context-router.md is not the live navigation mechanism. Agents navigate the knowledge base with the `search_project_context` MCP tool.

The `search_project_context` MCP tool uses BM25 keyword search to find relevant documentation across all routes. Agents should always search before working.

Routes follow a recursive tree structure with no depth limit. Each README can declare child routes for sub-areas.

## Assignees

Assignees are AI agent role profiles stored as JSON files in `.praxis/assignees/`. They define:
- Name and role (e.g., "Frontend Engineer", "Documentation Architect").
- Mission  -  what the agent is responsible for.
- Mandatory constraints  -  rules the agent must always follow.
- Edge cases and fallbacks  -  how to handle ambiguous situations.
- Workflow and response format  -  the expected output structure.

When `get_task` is called, the assignee profile is resolved and inlined into the task spec. The agent receives its role, constraints, and workflow instructions automatically.

Every project has a default assignee (`assistant.json`) that serves as the fallback when no specific assignee is assigned to a task.

## The MCP Codex

The behavioral rulebook source is `prompts/praxis-mcp-codex.md` (`.praxis/prompts/praxis-mcp-codex.md` is a runtime copy). It defines:
- The mandatory task lifecycle (above).
- Tool usage reference and parameter details.
- Workflow patterns (finishing tasks, creating tasks, locating docs).
- Global rules for all AI agents.

AI agents must read this file before starting any work. It is delivered via a read instruction in the system prompt or task prompt.

## Core Principles

- Local-first: all project data stays on the user's machine and is never uploaded to any server.
- The application itself is delivered over the network; local-first describes data ownership, not offline operation.
- Git-native: all tasks, assignees, and context are plain files  -  committable, diffable, branchable.
- Human control: every consequential decision requires human approval. Agents propose; humans decide.
- Specification-driven development (SDD): write the spec before writing the code. AI elaborates; human approves; AI executes.
- MCP-first: MCP tools are the primary integration layer. Clipboard prompts are a degraded-mode fallback.

## Invariants

- The `.praxis/` directory is the sole persistence layer for task and assignee data.
- The MCP server is always loopback-only (127.0.0.1:7865). No remote access.
- The file system is the source of truth. MCP is a convenience layer over files.
- No AI agent should act without reading its task spec and project context first.
- The task lifecycle is non-negotiable  -  agents must follow all 7 steps.

## Route-Specific Constraints

- This route is informational only. It explains PraxisOS to AI agents that are new to a PraxisOS-managed project.
- This route is intended to be copied into every user project during initialization.
- Content must remain tool-agnostic (not Claude-specific)  -  any MCP-compatible AI agent should understand it.
- Do not duplicate implementation details from other routes. Reference them instead.
- Keep language accessible to any AI model  -  no jargon without explanation.
